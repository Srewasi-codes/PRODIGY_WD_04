            <h2>~ About Me ~</h2>
            
            <p>As a BCA student, I am passionate about harnessing the power of technology to solve real-world problems and innovate for a better tomorrow. As a dedicated student at <b>assam down town  University</b>, I am immersed in a stimulating academic environment that fuels my passion for technology and innovation. My academic curriculum has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of core computer science principles, including algorithms, data structures, software development, and system design. Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ has been central to my education, enabling me to build and optimize software solutions efficiently. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer application with specialization in <b>cloud tech and information security</b> at assam down town University. I showcased my academic prowess alongside notable achievements.
               My journey into the world of technology and coding began as a curious teenager, fascinated by the endless possibilities that computers and software could offer. I began experimenting with simple programs, gradually progressing from basic HTML websites to more complex projects in Python and Java. The most notable being a responsive portfolio website developed using HTML and CSS, demonstrating my keen eye for web development and design.</p>
            <p>With a strong command of Python, Java, and C++, I excel in developing robust algorithms and efficient software solutions.I bring a blend of creativity and precision to every project. This versatile skill set not only demonstrates my technical prowess but also my ability to adapt and innovate in the fast-paced world of technology.</p><p> Additionally, I was involved in debugging and troubleshooting, which significantly improved my problem-solving abilities. As a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I have developed a comprehensive skill set that is crucial for solving complex computational problems efficiently. My proficiency in DSA is reflected in my ability to implement and optimize a wide range of algorithms using programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++. I have a deep understanding of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, which I leverage to design optimal solutions for various coding challenges.</p>
